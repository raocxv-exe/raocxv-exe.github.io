					<h2>Design process</h2>
					<p>In my UX/UI design process, I incorporate <u>empathy</u> to understand users' needs and emotions,
						creating solutions that resonate with them. <u>Aesthetics</u> play a crucial role in crafting
						visually
						appealing and engaging interfaces. User research helps me gather valuable insights to make
						informed decisions and design <u>user-centered</u> experiences.</p>

					<li class="style1">
						<span class="icon solid fa-book"></span>
						<strong>1. General needs</strong>

				<p class="content">1. Is essential to me because it ensures that I can create meaningful and impactful
					experiences. By understanding user needs, I can design solutions that address their pain points,
					enhance usability, and ultimately deliver products that resonate with and delight users.
					<br>2. User research, gather feedback, and analyze user behaviors. By closely examining user
					interactions, jobs they must do, gains and pains, I can uncover identify the problem and extreme
					user that also have that problem.
					<br>3. I immerse myself in their context, pain points, and goals, allowing me to understand their
					perspective. This empathetic approach guides me in designing intuitive and user-centric interfaces
					that address their specific needs.
					<br>4. Creating dozens of solutions, no matter how crazy the solutions may sound, but of course
					respecting the requirements I select the ones that makes the most sense and fun to do.
					<br>5. I make prototypes of said solutions and test them with the users, the extreme user and persons
					that don’t have the same problems, if one is a clear winner then I take the feedback and fix or
					change what needs it.

					<h2>About me</h2>

						<h3>My name is Rolando</h3>
					</li>
					<p>
						I have always been fascinated by human-centered design. I
						believe that well-designed interfaces have the power to enhance user satisfaction,
						engagement, and overall product success. My goal as a software engineer is to bridge the gap
						between technical functionality and user needs by creating seamless and delightful
						experiences.
						<p>
							Throughout my academic journey at Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, I've gained a strong
							foundation in computer science, programming
							languages, and software development methodologies, also gained good friends and enjoyed my
							time with them.
							I possess a strong creative flair and an eye for aesthetics. I enjoy combining my technical
							expertise with my passion for design to create user-centric experiences that are both
							visually
							appealing and intuitive to use. I understand the importance of conducting user research,
							prototyping, and iterating based on user feedback to create optimal user experiences.
						</p>
						<P>
							If you're looking for a motivated software engineer with a passion for UX/UI, I would love
							to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your organization. Together, we can create
							software
							applications that not only meet technical requirements but also exceed user expectations in
							terms of usability and aesthetics.
							Thank you for considering my profile, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to
							your team and make a positive impact in the world of software development and user
							experience
							design.
						</P>
						<P>
							In my free time I like to play videogames like league of legends, Halo or Legend of Zelda, I
							like to watch movies just to add reviews on my letterbox, but most of all I really enjoy to
							spend time with my dogs.
						</P>
